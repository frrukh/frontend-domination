// COMPONENT:
    // a Component is a dummy structure of any object in jsx that creates any thing that may be repeated later.
    // actually COMPONENTS are the functions that returns some jsx.
    //  it is a good practice to make the functional component's name similar to the file name and start with capital letter.
    // functional component:
        // the function that returns a jsx is called functional component.
        // today's react is totally uses functional components.
    // class based components:
        // these components were used in old react and not used now a days.
    


// Flow of react app:
    // we create a components folder in src and make components in it and then we create the whole page structure by importing the components in App.jsx and after that we import that in main.jsx that is responsible for creating a virtual DOM and loading your page code, coming from App.jsx, into that virtual DOM.
