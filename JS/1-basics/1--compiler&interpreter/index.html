// COMPILER & INTERPRETER.

// COMPILER:
    // it is a translator that converts the code in to machine language i.e. 0/1.
    // it translates slower than interpreter but its running speed is faster.

// INTERPRETER:
    // it is also a interpreter that converts the code but not in to machine language, into byte code.
    // it translates faster than compiler but its running speed is slower.

//********************
// Q: What is byte code?
    // A: it is the code that is almost 85% far than our english code and 15% closer to the machine language.
//********************

//********************
// Q: Is the final running code is byte code in interpreter case?
    // A: No! after the conversion into byte code it converted into machine code i.e. 0/1.
//********************


// JIT-COMPILER:
    // In both transactions there is some issue. one is slower in translation, and another is slower in running. to get the fastest results a new translator comes into the game and that is JIT-COMPILER. it takes translating speed from interpreter and running speed from compiler.
