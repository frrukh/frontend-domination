// we can run just js file without html using command: node filename

// OBJECTS:
    // on new thing you should keep in mind that you can crete an object like this way:

var a = "name"
var b = "age"
var c = "gender"

var obj = {a, b, c} // this will keep your variables as key and their values as the values.

console.log(obj) // { a: 'name', b: 'age', c: 'gender' }
